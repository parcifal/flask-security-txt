# Flask-SecurityTxt

Flask-SecurityTxt allows you to generate a security.txt-file for your
Flask-based app using minimal configuration. The following values are
automatically generated by default:

 - `Contact`
 - `Expires`
 - `Canonical`

In case your app uses Flask-Babel, the `Preferred languages` field is derived
from that. Generating a signed security.txt is also possible. To do so, simply
supply Flask-SecurityTxt with a PGP private key.
